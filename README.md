# FullFace3MAdapter
A full face snorkeling mask adapter for 3m filters

This design provides an adapter for p100 filters to a full face snorkeling mask, this to serve as protection for doctors and nurses tending the COVID-19 crisis
I HAVE NOT DONE ANY TESTING ON THIS YET

There are currently 2 versions. One with 2 one way valves to control intake and explusion of air through diferent filters, the other uses the standard management the mask uses
