# FullFace3MAdapter
A full face snorkeling mask adapter for 3M filters

THE MOST UP TO DATE FILES ARE: Adaptador.STL AND Body1.STL

This design provides an adapter for 3M Bayonet mount filters to a full face snorkeling mask, this to serve as protection for doctors and nurses tending the COVID-19 crisis
I HAVE NOT DONE ANY TESTING ON THIS YET

There are currently 2 versions. One with 2 one way valves to control intake and explusion of air through diferent filters, the other uses the standard management the mask uses


This is designed for the Decathon masks only, although other manufacturers have provided their own adapters for other types of filters.

If you do test this out please contact me at my website:
